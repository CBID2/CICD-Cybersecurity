 Protect the Software (PS) for Build and Deploy CI/CD Steps
---


### Protect the Software (PS)
Protect the Software (PS): Organizations should protect all components of their
software from tampering and unauthorized access.

<br>

**PS.1**

<strong>Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering </strong>: Help prevent unauthorized changes to code, both inadvertent and intentional, which could circumvent or negate the intended security characteristics of the software. For code that is not intended to be publicly accessible, this helps prevent theft of the software and may make it more difficult or time-consuming for attackers to find vulnerabilities in the software.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PS.1 in a build and deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts from just defining to:

- Secure the CI/CD pipeline itself – ensure only trusted, authenticated processes can produce build outputs.

- Protect source inputs and dependencies, lock versions, use checksums, and prevent injection of malicious code into the build process.

- Sign artifacts and record provenance, generate cryptographically verifiable metadata proving what was built, from which source, and by whom.

- Enforce reproducible builds so that any tampering results in a hash/signature mismatch.

- Restrict build system access and enforce role-based permissions, MFA, and least privilege for build servers

**PS.2**

<strong>Provide a Mechanism for Verifying Software Release Integrity:</strong> Help software acquirers ensure that the software they acquire is legitimate and has not been tampered with. Make software integrity verification information available to software acquirers.

<br>


To satisfy SSDF PS.2 in a build and deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Generate integrity artifacts for every release

- Bind artifacts to versioned source

- Publish verification materials

- Require integrity checks as a release gate

- Expose verification data to consumers

- Admission control based on integrity

**PS.3**

<strong> Archive and Protect Each Software Release:</strong> Preserve software releases in order to help identify, analyze, and eliminate vulnerabilities discovered in the software after release.

<br>


To satisfy SSDF PS.3 in a build and deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Build: The emphasis is on capturing, storing, and securing every official release (source, binaries, SBOM, signatures, provenance) in immutable, versioned storage.

- Deploy: The emphasis is on ensuring only those archived, protected releases are used in production with immutability, digest pinning, and signature/provenance verification as enforcement mechanisms.
