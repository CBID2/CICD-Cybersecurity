 Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV) for Build and Deploy CI/CD Steps
---



### Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)

Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV): Organizations should identify residual vulnerabilities
in their software releases and respond appropriately to address those vulnerabilities and prevent similar ones from occurring in the future.



<br>

**RV.1**

<strong>Identify and Confirm Vulnerabilities on an Ongoing Basis: </strong> Help ensure that vulnerabilities are identified more quickly so that they can be remediated more quickly in accordance with risk, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF RV.1 in a build and deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to continuously gathering vulnerability intel (VDP + public sources), monitor components, and confirm issues across supported releases.

      <p>RV.1.2: Review, analyze, and/or test the softwareâ€™s code to identify or  confirm the presence of previously undetected vulnerabilities.</p><br>
      <p>RV.1.3: Have a policy that addresses vulnerability disclosure and remediation, and implement the roles, responsibilities, and processes needed to support that policy.</p>

**RV.2**

<strong>Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities:</strong> Help ensure that
vulnerabilities are remediated in accordance with risk to reduce the window of  opportunity for attackers.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF RV.2 in a build and deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Recording each vulnerability

- Analyze risk (exploitability & impact)

- Choose responses, publish advisories, and deliver remediations via trusted mechanisms; include temporary mitigations where needed.\

<p><strong>Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes: </strong> Help reduce the frequency of vulnerabilities in the future.</p><br>

<br>

To satisfy SSDF RV.3 in a build and deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Capturing root causes & lessons learned

- Detecting recurring patterns over time

      <p>RV.3.3: Review the software for similar vulnerabilities to eradicate a class of vulnerabilities, and proactively fix them rather than waiting for external reports.</p> <br>
      <p>RV.3.4: Review the SDLC process, and update it if appropriate to prevent (or reduce the likelihood of) the root cause recurring in updates to the software or in new software that is created.</p> <br>
