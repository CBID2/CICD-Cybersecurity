### Protect the Organization (PO)
Ensure that security requirements for software development are known at all times so that they can be taken into account throughout the SDLC and duplication of effort can be minimized because the requirements information can be collected once and shared. This includes requirements from internal sources (e.g., the organization’s policies,business objectives, and risk management strategy) and external sources (e.g., applicable laws and regulations).
